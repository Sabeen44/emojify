# Emojify-Group Project

## Overview

There are thousands of movies available for streaming. Users end up spending hours to pick a movie. This app makes it easier for users to decide on a movie based on user's moods and inclinations that are expressed through emojis. The user is presented with emojis to pick from and the algorithm recommends a list of movies.
